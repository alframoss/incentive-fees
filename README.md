# Incentive Fees in Hedge Fund Management

This GitHub repository contains all the work related to my masters thesis.

## Description

We consider an expected utility maximising manager who controls the allocation of wealth between a riskless and risky asset. The manager has power utility describing their terminal wealth preference. The managerâ€™s compensation includes both a management fee and a performance fee based on exceeding the high-water mark of the fund. Under assumptions about the continuous-time financial market and the asset prices, we present a numerical solution of the optimal trading strategy.
